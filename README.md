# firstai
This is a very old project and my first attempt at machine learning.

It's on Khan Academy because that's where I first learned how to program. Much later, I would find out about Eclipse and would switch to that.

This AI a simple neural network with an input, hidden, and output layers (6, 8, 2). It uses ReLU as the activation function and also uses Layer Normalization (but I had mistakenly called it Batch Normalization in the code).
